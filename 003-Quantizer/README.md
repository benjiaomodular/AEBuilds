# Quantizer

This is a minimal quantizer based on the Arduino Nano.

## Circuit
Original code and circuit was based on [HAGIWO's DIY Quantizer build](https://note.com/solder_state/n/nde97a0516f03).

This version is stripped down with no frontpanel controls and is fixed to one scale. I intend to expand this in the future.
