A simple DIY clock module for AEModular based on the ATtiny85. Code is based on [robstave's ACS-85-0020 "Adjustable Square Wave"](https://github.com/robstave/ArduinoComponentSketches/tree/master/ACS-85%20ATTiny85%20sketches/ACS-85-0020).

## Circuit
Not much going on with the circuit on this one. Just 1k resistors on the outputs, 1k resistor on the LED, and 10k pots setup as voltage dividers. I will post the schematic of this soon.

## Panel
The frontpanel I used for my build was 3D printed in PLA and designed using my [AEPanelMaker library for OpenSCAD](https://github.com/benjiaomodular/AEPanelMaker). I built the circuit on perfboard.
